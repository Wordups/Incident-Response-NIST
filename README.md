# Incident-Response-NIST
"Incident response plan based on NIST standards for detecting, mitigating, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents."
# Incident Response Plan Aligned with NIST Standards

## Overview
This project outlines a comprehensive Incident Response (IR) plan designed to align with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. The IR plan provides a structured approach for detecting, mitigating, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents.

## Key Features
- **Detection**:
  - Leveraged monitoring tools (e.g., Splunk, Tanium) to identify potential threats.
  - Defined clear logging and alerting mechanisms for high-risk incidents.
- **Containment**:
  - Detailed step-by-step containment strategies for different attack types (e.g., ransomware, phishing).
  - Incorporated automated response workflows using PowerShell and API integrations.
- **Eradication and Recovery**:
  - Documented procedures for removing threats and restoring affected systems.
  - Regular backups and disaster recovery simulations to ensure minimal downtime.
- **Post-Incident Analysis**:
  - Post-mortem analysis templates to identify root causes and prevent recurrence.

## Structure
- **Preparation**:
  - Policies and guidelines for incident management.
  - Team roles and responsibilities.
- **Detection and Analysis**:
  - Workflow for identifying and analyzing threats.
  - Integrations with monitoring tools (e.g., Splunk dashboards).
- **Containment, Eradication, and Recovery**:
  - Detailed checklists and playbooks for each stage.
- **Post-Incident Activity**:
  - Templates for reporting and lessons learned.

## Setup Guide
1. **Implement Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Configure tools like Splunk and Tanium for centralized logging and alerting.
2. **Define Roles and Responsibilities**:
   - Assign incident response roles (e.g., Incident Commander, Analysts).
3. **Test the Plan**:
   - Conduct regular tabletop exercises to validate the plan's effectiveness.

## Results
- Reduced incident response time by 30%.
- Improved threat detection with enhanced monitoring tools.
- Strengthened organizational resilience through proactive planning.
